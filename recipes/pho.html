    <p>This authentic pho recipe was adapted from Chef Eric of Ba Bar's pho recipe. Be sure to plan ahead — authentic
        pho requires six to 10 hours of cooking time for a flavorful bone broth. For best results, use shank and knee
        beef bones.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds beef soup bones</li>
        <li>1 onion, unpeeled and cut in half</li>
        <li>5 slices fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>2 pods star anise</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>4 quarts water</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package dried rice noodles</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds beef top sirloin, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped green onion</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups bean sprouts</li>
        <li>1 bunch Thai basil</li>
        <li>1 lime, cut into 4 wedges</li>
        <li>¼ cup hoisin sauce (Optional)</li>
        <li>¼ cup chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®) (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place beef bones on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until browned, about one hour.</li>
        <li>Place onion on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until blackened and soft, about 45 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Place bones, onion, ginger, salt, star anise, and fish sauce in a large stockpot and cover with four quarts
            of water. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low. Simmer on low for six to 10 hours. Strain the broth into a
            saucepan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place rice noodles in a large bowl filled with room temperature water and allow to soak for one hour. Bring
            a large pot of water to a boil and after the noodles have soaked, place them in the boiling water for one
            minute. Bring stock to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Divide noodles among four serving bowls; top with sirloin, cilantro, and green onion. Pour hot broth over
            the top. Stir and let sit until the beef is partially cooked and no longer pink, one to two minutes. Serve
            with bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, hoisin sauce, and chile-garlic sauce on the side.</li>
    </ol>
